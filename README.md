# House-buying-classification-using-Tensorflow

This machine learning code basically decides whether to buy a house or not. It uses one layer perceptron/ feed foreward neural network.

You can replace your data file with data.csv.

To successfully run this code you will need:
1) tensorflow
2) pandas
3) numpy
4) Jupyter notebook


We can see the power of neural net even though it has one layer and 10 training examples as it predicts 7 correct out of 10 after training.
To improve accuracy, we can increase training data, and increase training epochs.
